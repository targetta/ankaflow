def register_macro(name: str, definition: str) -> None:
    """Register a new custom SQL macro.

    This function adds a user-defined macro to the global registry so it will be
    created in the `Fn` schema at pipeline initialization. Macros are defined by
    their SQL body only (excluding the `CREATE MACRO` wrapper). For example:

        ```
        register_macro("answer", "() AS 42")
        ```

    After initialization, the mcro can be called in SQL as:

        ```
        SELECT Fn.answer();
        ```

    Rules and behavior:

        * Built-in macros defined on the :class:`Fn` class cannot be overridden.
          Attempting to register a macro with the same name will raise
          :class:`ValueError`.
        * The `definition` is automatically normalized by stripping whitespace
          and removing any trailing semicolon.
        * Registered macros are stored globally for the lifetime of the process.
          Re-registering the same name will overwrite the previous definition.

    Args:
        name (str): Macro name (identifier only, without `Fn.` prefix).
        definition (str): SQL macro body, starting with the parameter signature
            (e.g. `"(x, y) AS x + y"`).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the given name conflicts with a built-in macro.
