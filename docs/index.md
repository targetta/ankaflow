# AnkaFlow - Run Data Pipelines Anywhere

**From REST APIs to SQL, from Local Python to Browser Execution**

---

## What is AnkaFlow?

AnkaFlow is a YAML-driven, SQL-powered data pipeline framework designed for both local Python and in-browser (Pyodide) execution. It enables seamless extraction, transformation, and joining of data across REST APIs, cloud storage, and databases, all without writing custom Python code.

**Write your pipeline once, run it anywhere.**

---

## Key Features

- **Dual Execution Modes**: Run pipelines locally or fully in-browser with Pyodide.
- **DuckDB In-Memory SQL Engine**: Fast, scalable analytics with SQL.
- **Dynamic Templating**: Full support for variable injection, header and query templating.
- **REST & GraphQL Support**: Production-ready REST and GraphQL connectors with error handling and polling.
- **Joins Across REST and SQL**: Native support for combining API responses with SQL datasets.
- **Python Transform Stage**: Execute custom Python logic inline within your pipeline.
- **DeltaLake, BigQuery, S3, MSSQL, Oracle**: Seamlessly connect to enterprise data sources.
- **YAML Anchors & References**: DRY pipeline definitions with reusable components.
- **Async Ready and Future-Proof**: Designed for scalable and parallel execution.

## Example Use Cases

- **Data Enrichment Pipelines**: Join Shopify orders (REST), DeltaLake financials, BigQuery users, and real-time weather data.
- **Browser-Based Data Apps**: Execute pipelines directly in the browser, preserving data privacy.
- **ML Feature Engineering**: Combine SQL and Python transform steps for complex feature generation.
- **SaaS Product Integrations**: Embed pipelines into dashboards, trigger REST calls, and process responses.
- **Ad-hoc Analysis and Reporting**: Dynamic pipelines for analysts and consultants, no Python code required.
